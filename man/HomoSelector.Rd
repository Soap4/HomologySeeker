\arguments{
\item{RefSpec, QuySpec}{Names of reference(ref) and query(quy) species in comparative analysis. Case is ignored.
See GetSpecNames() for detailed list.}

\item{homotype}{Homologous gene relationship between two species:
\itemize{
 \item{ortholog_one2one} \strong{:} One-to-one orthologues(Default).
 \item{ortholog_one2many} \strong{:} One-to-many orthologues.
 \item{ortholog_many2many} \strong{:} Many-to-many orthologues.
 }}

\item{version}{Ensembl version to be connected. See biomaRt::useEnsembl() for detailed information.}

\item{usedataset}{Whether use pre-built datasets from Ensembl gene version 108}
}
\value{
Table of homologous genes list between species 1 and species 2
}
\description{
Get homologous gene set and information between two species
}
\details{
Due to the query issue after the latest update to Ensembl version 106 as described in
'https://github.com/grimbough/biomaRt/issues/61', currently the version '105' is the most stable one.
If other Ensembl version are needed, the online source of BioMart ('http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview')
are avilable for querying homologous information among species. We also implement available datasets: Human2Mouse,
Human2Zebrafish and Mouse2Zebrafish in HomoSeeker (load with data() function) and deposite in our GitHub
repository under Ensembl gene verison 108:'https://github.com/Soap4/Data'.

\dontrun{
# Get Homologous gene list between mouse and human

Homo_mat <- HomoSelector(RefSpec = "mouse",RefSpec = "human")

# Or get available datasets in HomoSeeker:

Human2Mouse <- read.csv("https://github.com/Soap4/Data/files/10098277/Orthologues_Human2Mouse_v108.csv",row.names = 1)
Human2Zebrafish <- read.csv("https://github.com/Soap4/Data/files/10098276/Orthologues_Human2Zebrafish_v108.csv",row.names = 1)
Mouse2Zebrafish <- read.csv("https://github.com/Soap4/Data/files/10098275/Orthologues_Mouse2Zebrafish_v108.csv",row.names = 1)
}
